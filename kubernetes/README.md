# Tasks

## Access the lab environment

Your proctors should present you a link to the environment.

Follow instructions in [../cloudshell.md](../cloudshell.md) to activate a cloud-based bash shell.

## Provision requirements

**In your cloud shell**, copy the Application/Client Id and Application Secret Key provided in your lab guide to environment variables as below:

```
appId=(paste from lab guide)
appSecret=(paste from lab guide)
```

Verify values are correct by typing:

```
echo $appId $appSecret
```

To provision the AKS cluster, run the following:

```
rgName=${1:-$(az group list --query [0].name -o tsv)}

az aks create --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --name <unique-aks-cluster-name> \
    --location <region> \
    --kubernetes-version $version \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
    --min-count 1 \
    --max-count 3 \
    --load-balancer-sku basic \
    --service-principal <APP_ID> \
    --client-secret <APP_SECRET> 

```
