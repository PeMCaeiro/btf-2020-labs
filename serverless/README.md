# Tasks

## Access the lab environment

Your proctors should present you a link to the environment.

## Access your cloud shell

Follow instructions in [../cloudshell.md](../cloudshell.md) to activate a cloud-based bash shell.

## Provision requirements

In your cloud shell, run the following:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shoegazerpt/MCW-Serverless-architecture/btf2020/Hands-on%20lab/deploy/deploy.sh | bash -s
```

It takes about 12 minutes to get the resources fully configured.
